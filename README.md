# Journey

> Recall the journey, not the destination.

Like a combination of [The Backloggery](https://www.backloggery.com), [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com), and [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com), Journey looks to provide a new method for tracking your video game library and playthroughs by providing new insights into the way you like to play video games.  With Journey, backlog completion isn't the only goal, it's understanding that it takes time to finish a game and that time is _fun_.  Using Journey, you'll share your experiences with other players and interact with friends about your favorite games.

# Proposed Features
